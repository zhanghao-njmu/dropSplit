Title: Automatically identify cell-containing and empty droplets for droplet-based scRNAseq data using dropSplit
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Hao Zhang
Maintainer: Hao Zhang <542370159@qq.com>
Description: dropSplit is designed to identify true cells from droplet-based scRNAseq data. 
    It consists of three parts: quality control for all droplets, model construction, cell identification.
    dropSplit provides some special QC metrics such as CellEntropy or CellGini which can help identification.
    In general, user can use the predefined parameters in the XGBoost and get the important features that help in cell identification.
    It also implements a automatic XGBoost hyperparameters-tuning function to optimize the model.
